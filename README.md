# My Project Proposal

### NotePad Re-imagined

The name of the project that I have decided to pursue is called ***VimPad***. 
VimPad is intended to be the fusion of Microsoft's *Notepad* and Bram Moolenaar's Vi Improved (a.k.a. *Vim*) 
with a bunch of quality of life improvements. It will be a semi-basic text editing and writing software using
the text input and navigation methods of Vim.

The application will have the following features:
- A primarily keyboard-based input and navigation 
system modeled off of Vim's
- A basic, bare-bones text-editing environment like Notepad
but with some added quality of life features like varied text size, **bolding** and *italicizing*
- An in-app file navigation system (so you don't need to open file explorer)
- The ability to support different languages (like japanese and arabic) 

The main user of this application will be myself and all the other Vim lovers. This could also be of interest for 
people who are interested in Vim but not into 
programming or computer science or tired of using their touchpad or mouse.

One of the motivating causes for my interest in this application,
is the lack of use cases for Vim outside of programming. Since I am primarily a laptop user, it is inconvenient for me 
to use my touchpad when coding or typing in general. At the same time, Vim by itself is incredibly bare-bones, 
that is why I use the Vim extension for VsCode. The same thing is true for Notepad. I don't like the auto indenting 
and other "helpful" features other text editing software like Google Docs or Microsoft Word have, I find that they
take control away from the author. But unfortunately, NotePad is even more basic than Vim. This is why I
want to add more features to it. Finally, I like learning languages, and I can't find an easy-to-use program to
create dictionaries or grammar guides for myself.
