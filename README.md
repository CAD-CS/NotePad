# My Project Proposal

### NotePad Re-imagined

The name of the project that I have decided to pursue is called ***VimPad***. 
VimPad is intended to be an improvement of Microsoft's *Notepad* 
with features that will make it feel like an actual notepad. I will also try to implement the text input method of 
Bram Moolenaar's Vi Improved (a.k.a. *Vim*) but on professor Wolfman's advice, 
I will implement it at the end if I have time.

The application will have the following features:
- A primarily keyboard-based input and navigation 
system modeled off of Vim's
- A basic, bare-bones text-editing environment like Notepad
- A system of notes and pads. Where you can add notes to your pad and have multiple pads similar to a real notepad. 
Allegorically, adding sticky notes to your wall 

The main user of this application will be myself and all the other Vim lovers. This could also be of interest for 
people who are interested in Vim but not into 
programming or computer science or tired of using their touchpad or mouse. Or just people who want more from Notepad

One of the motivating causes for my interest in this application,
is the lack of use cases for Vim outside of programming. Since I am primarily a laptop user, it is inconvenient for me 
to use my touchpad when coding or typing in general. At the same time, Vim by itself is incredibly bare-bones, 
that is why I use the Vim extension for VsCode. The same thing is true for Notepad. I don't like the auto indenting 
and other "helpful" features other text editing software like Google Docs or Microsoft Word have, I find that they
take control away from the author. But unfortunately, NotePad is even more basic than Vim. This is why I
want to add more features to it. I want to better organize my thoughts and group them.
Finally, I like learning languages, and I can't find an easy-to-use program to
create dictionaries or grammar guides for myself.

### User Stories

1. As a user, I would like to create a new **Note** and add it to an existing **Pad**
2. As a user, I would like to select an existing **Note** from a **Pad** and modify its contents
3. As a user, I would like to remove an existing **Note** from a **Pad**
4. As a user, I would like to have multiple **Pads**
5. As a user, I would like to save my list of **Pads** to file
6. As a user, I would like to load my list of **Pads** from file
